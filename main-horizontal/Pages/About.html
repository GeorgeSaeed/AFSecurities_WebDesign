                          <p>	Launched in 2001, AF Securities, formerly known as Arab Finance Brokerage, made its debut in the market as the first online platform for executing purchase and sale transactions on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and as an EGX-focused news portal.	</p>
                          <p>	The company then obtained a securities license in 2008, allowing it to expand further. Through its journey, the company has witnessed several ownerships, of which the latest was in March 2018 when it was acquired by new management with an eye for a complete growth-focused revamp,  through setting a new culture and strategy for the company. The management's solid expertise and background in the financial industry enabled it to restructure the firm internally and introduce new products with different flavors than others in the market.	</p>
                          <p>	Eventually, the company has been separated into two entities of business to enhance the value delivered: <a href="https://www.arabfinance.com/en/home">Arab Finance for Information
                          Technology </a>and AF Securities.	</p>                        </div>
