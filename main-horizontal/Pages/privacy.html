                    <h5 class="baby">	How we use the information we gather	</h5>
                        
                    <p>	Generally, we will not disclose personally identifiable information that we collect through your use of the Site to unaffiliated third parties. We reserve the right, however, to provide such information to our employees, contractors, agents, and designees to the extent necessary to enable them to perform certain Site-related services. We also reserve the right to disclose such information to any third party if we believe that we are required to do so for any or all of the following reasons: (i) by law; (ii) to comply with legal processes or governmental requests; (iii) to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of the Site or our network; and/or (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of AF Securities its partners, and employees, the users of the Site, or the public.	</p>

                    <h5 class="baby">	Security	</h5>
                        
                    <p>	AF Securities seeks to adopt commercially reasonable security measures to assist in protecting against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information which is under our control. Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of the foregoing, while we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between your computer and AF Securities servers, or any information provided to us or to any third party through or in connection with the Site. You provide all such information entirely at your own risk.	</p>
                        
                    <h5 class="baby">	Revisions to Privacy Policy	</h5>
                        
                    <p>	AF Securities reserves the right to update and revise this Privacy Policy at any time. Your use of our Site constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the Privacy Policy as amended or revised by us, and you should therefore review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms.	</p>
